**Keywords** Groundwater, Objective MCDM algorithm, Sustainability. 

**Description** Under review manuscript (2025). 

### Highlights 
- Applied Integrated Determination of Objective Criteria Weights-Combined Compromise Solution (IDOCRIW-CoCoSo) multi-criteria decision-making approach.

- Utilized remote sensing and geophysical conditioning datasets for the modelling.

- Used other objective models (CRITIC-CoCoSo, and Mean Weighted CoCoSo) as comparative tools. 

### Methodology ### 
- Creation of conditioning factors maps using ArcGIS 10.8.2 software. 

- Fishnet points extraction into Python programming coded models. 

- Groundwater potential maps have been generated based on the models. 

- Reliability and comparative analysis were adopted leveraging on statistical analysis like Boostrapping of AUC results

### Findings 
- Potentiality indices varied significantly across the location in the study area. 

- GIS integration improved spatial accuracy. 

- The methodology is adaptable to other regions with similar geologic context.
 
- IDOCRIW-CoCoSo demonstrated stability during scenario analysis

- The produced groundwater potential map (IDOCRIW-CoCoSo) is advantageous in meeting SDG 6.1 goals
