## Bio

I am an early career geoscientist interested in understanding how natural systems behave and how environmental research can be advanced through emerging data-driven techniques. My academic and project experience spans hydrogeology, environmental geophysics, geospatial analysis, and machine learning applications in the Earth sciences. I mostly enjoy working at the intersection of field observations, quantitative modelling, and computational methods. 

I am motivated by research that strengthens groundwater sustainability, environmental resilience, and resource exploration, especially in data-scarce regions. My goal is to contribute to research and collaborations that make practical impact through data driven scientific analysis.


## Research interests

- Groundwater resources and environmental hydrogeology
- GIS, remote sensing, and geospatial modelling
- Environmental geophysics and subsurface characterization
- Machine learning and data-driven approaches in geoscience
- Natural resources assessment and environmental sustainability

## For collaborations

Fun fact: I enjoy working on challenging problems because they drive growth and create opportunities to learn and apply new tools.

I am actively seeking collaborative opportunities across the Earth and environmental sciences, particularly in areas where data, modelling, and field insights can be integrated to solve real-world environmental challenges.
